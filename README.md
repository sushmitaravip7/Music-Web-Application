# Music-Web-Application

Developed a web application to get information about music artists, their albums, etc using REST AP using JavaScript and Ajax.

- install the XAMPP web server.
- use the Web Service REST API of the music application Last.fm. You first need to get an API access key from Get an API Account at Last.fm. The access key will allow you to send   web service requests to Last.fm
